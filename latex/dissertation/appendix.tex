Alternatively to the inequality ratio \(IR\) we can use a variant of the Theil Index, which is a special case of the General Entropy measures, as follows:

\[
T(G) = \frac{1}{J}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\frac{s_j}{\mu_s}arsinh(\frac{s_j}{\mu_s}),
\]

where \(s_j\) denotes the group averages, as previously defined for \(IR\), \(J\) denotes the numbers of groups and \(\mu\) the unweighted mean of all \(s_j\). Instead of the natural logarithm, as is normally used for the Theil Index, we use an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (\(arsinh\)). It has the advantage of being defined for zero values, which is a problem that we would inevitably run into with education data from low- and middle-income countries.

Repeating the regressions shown in Table \ref{tab:ratios}, but with inequality measured by the Theil Index instead of the inequality ratio leads to the results reported in Table \ref{tab:theil}. The results remain fairly comparable.
